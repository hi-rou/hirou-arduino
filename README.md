## 작품의 기능
- By pairing the application with the device, HiRou measures the weight of the water it contains to manage the user's water intake. This product tracks daily water consumption and notifies user through the app, helping them develop healthy water intake habits.
<br/>

## 영감의 원천
-  According to WHO, an analysis of the data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey over the past five years revealed that 62% of South Koreans do not meet the recommended water intake for their age group. Modern people often fail to consume sufficient water due to their busy lifestyles, leading many to take on the challenge of drinking 2 liters of water a day. However, it is difficult to track whether they have actually consumed 2 liters of water daily, making it challenging to maintain this habit. This issue is occurring not only in South Korea but also worldwide.
<br/>

## 작동 원리 
1. Use a load cell to measure weight changes and convert these measurements to ML to calculate water intake.
2. Change the LED color to indicate the operational status of each function.
3. Pair with a mobile application via Bluetooth to send and receive data periodically.
4. Monitor the user's weekly water intake through the weekly statistics feature.
5. Compare the user's current water intake with their set goal, and provide notifications if the goal is not met to encourage hydration.
<br>
  HiRou pairs with a mobile application via Bluetooth, allowing for periodic data transmission between the device and the app. The load cell inside the device measures weight changes, which are then converted to ML to calculate water intake. The LED indicates the operational status of each function. The device compares the user's current water intake with their set goal and sends notifications at scheduled times if the goal is not met to encourage the user to drink more water.

## 개발 과정
- We recognized the issue that many people do not consume enough water in their daily lives and conducted thorough research to address it. Through our research process, we reaffirmed the importance of water. Water plays a crucial role not only in skin health, weight loss, and waste removal but also in preventing various diseases such as pneumonia, bronchitis, inflammatory urinary tract diseases, diabetes, hypertension, and angina. Based on this understanding, we aimed to develop a product that facilitates maintaining adequate hydration. From the early stages of product development, we prioritized user portability and optimized the product's weight, durability, connectivity, and operational efficiency through extensive testing and 3D modeling. Additionally, we implemented features such as Bluetooth connectivity, weight measurement, notification functions, weekly statistics, and goal setting in the application, enabling users to manage their water intake effectively from anywhere. Our product provides more than just a water bottle; it is an essential tool for a healthy lifestyle. By using this product, users can continuously monitor their health status and take actions when needed. This contributes to improving individual health and enhancing overall quality of life.
<br/>

## 독창성
- Our device can be attached and detached from existing tumblers, making it compatible with any tumbler. Currently, most hydration management applications require users to take photos for verification or manually record their water intake, which can be inconvenient. However, our device eliminates these inconveniences by automatically tracking the user's water intake when attached to the tumbler, providing a convenient way to measure hydration. This device can be easily attached to any tumbler, allowing users to monitor their daily water intake in real-time. This enables users to manage their health effortlessly, without the need for manual recording or complex procedures.
<br/>

## 향후 계획
- Our project aims to develop an advanced healthcare device that can be utilized in both medical and educational settings. To achieve this, we plan to add a health management tab to the device, allowing users to input their weight and height for optimal recommendations. Additionally, we intend to use sophisticated PCB manufacturing technology to reduce the size and weight of the product. HiRou will also add a tumbler customization feature, a current trend, making it an important item that takes responsibility for health. Thus, our project offers various measures to enhance public health and aims to grow into a technology recognized globally.
